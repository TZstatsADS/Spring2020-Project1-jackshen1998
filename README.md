### [Project Description](doc/)

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: Hip-Hop vs. R&B: Things You Don't Know
+ This project is conducted by Jiancong Shen

+ Project summary: I did some explortary data analysis on Hip-Hop and R&B lyrics by applying some text mining techniques and visualizing the results in the report. Main goal of this project is to discriminate Hip-Hop music from R&B music from a lyrical perspective. The outcome shows that Hip-Hop has more lyrics in one song, focuses on girls,money and gangster and expresses more anger.
